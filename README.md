# Database-Application-in-Python
This program will use these classes to build an application for an Employee Database. 
Each time you run the program, the user is allowed to repeatedly select from the seven choices described below: 
 
The Employee Database application contains seven options: 

Option 1: Accept input for new Employees. If the user chooses option 1, the program should ask the type of employee first and then guide the user to provide all required information. New employee will be added to a temporary “object container” and written into a new database when program exits. 
Option 2: Display employee information. If the user chooses option 2, the program should ask one question (introduced in the program template) and then display employee information. 
Option 3: List the name of all employees along with the compensation received by each. 
Option 4: Search for employees by name. If the user chooses option 4, the program should ask for a name and then display all employees that match the name search.  
Option 5: Display basic statistics (defined in the program template). 
Option 6: Calculate the reimbursement of one employee. If the user chooses option 6, the program should ask for a name and let the user to select one employee. Then certain information will be asked (depending on employee type) to calculate the weekly reimbursement. 
Option 7: Exit the system after writing all information to a new database/file. The program should ask if the user really wants to exit the system before closing the program.
